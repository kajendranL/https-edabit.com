#Create a function that determines whether or not it's possible to split a pie fairly given these three parameters:

#1.Total number of slices.
#2.Number of recipients.
#3.How many slices each person gets.
#The function will be in this form:

#It's fine not to use the entire pie.


def equal_slices(total, people, each):
	if people * each <=total:
		return True
	return False
	
	
	
print(equal_slices(11, 5, 2)) # True
# 5 people x 2 slices each = 10 slices < 11 slices 
print(equal_slices(11, 5, 3)) # False
# 5 people x 3 slices each = 15 slices > 11 slices
print(equal_slices(8, 3, 2)) # True
print(equal_slices(8, 3, 3)) # False
print(equal_slices(24, 12, 2)) # True
